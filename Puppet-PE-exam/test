40) class var_test { $osfamily = "test" notify { 'test': message => $osfamily, } notify { 'test': message => $::osfamily, } } Given the following code, what type of error will result when puppet parser validate is run?
Correct

Correct answer
Puppet parser will not report any errors

Explanation
var_test is an acceptable class name, class names can have underscores but MUST start with a lowercase letter. osfamily is local scope and can be reassigned since facts are top scope $::factname. An error will occur when the catalog is being compiled due to two resource titles having the same name. However, puppet parser will not catch those errors because puppet parser validates for syntax only.

41) You are managing a system with a modulepath of /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules. In which file will the autoloader look for the class definition for the ssh::server::keys class?
Correct

Correct answer
/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules/ssh/manifests/server/keys.pp

47) You want to use live management to trigger a Puppet agent run only on nodes running Red Hat Enterprise Linux and its derivatives. How do you proceed?
Incorrect

Correct answer
Use the advanced filter to filter by facts for osfamily, with a value of RedHat, and trigger a run using the Control Puppet section of live management.

48) True or False: When installing the Puppet master and Console on separate servers, installing the console before the Puppet master could cause Puppet master installation to fail.
Correct

Correct answer
True

49) If the operating system of the node is SUSE what would you expect to happen given the following code: package { ‘resource-title’ : name => $::operatingsystem ? { ‘redhat’ => ‘httpd’, ‘debian’ => ‘apache2’, }, ensure => installed, }
Correct

Correct answer
The compile would fail because no default match was provided

Correct answer
redhat.mydomain.com, webserver.mydomain.com,dev.mydomain.com,www.mydomain.com

53) True or False: Selector expressions can be used within a case statements case.
Correct

Correct answer
False

54) Given the following code, what key should be added to the YAML data source in order for automatic parameter lookup to apply to this class?: class ntp ($ntp = "default") { }
Correct

Correct answer
ntp::ntp: server.com

55) If refreshonly is set to true, the exec will only run when it receives an event. This is the most reliable way to use refresh with execs.
Correct

Correct answer

63) class var_test::test { $myvar = "test" } class var_test { include var_test::test $osfamily = "test" notify { 'test1': message => "this is the test, {$myvar}", } } Given the above code, what would you expect the notify message to output during the puppet run? Hint: This question is focused on scope and what the variable should be since we used the include function.
Incorrect

Correct answer
this is the test, {}

Explanation
The include function does not imply scope. It only "declares" the class, the $myvar variable is still out of scope and could only be used through inheritance or $var_test::test::myvar variable name calling the scope of the variable.

64) Given the following Puppet code what value would you expect $server to have when executed in the notify resource?: node "webserver.mylabserver.com" { $server = "10.0.0.1" class { 'ntp' : server = "10.0.0.2", } } class ntp ($server = "localhost") { notify ("The value of the server variable is ${server}":) }

Correct

Correct answer
mysql, common

Explanation
First Puppet looks for an exact match, then puppet looks for a regular expression match, then if the cert name looks like a FQDN Puppet will look for a definition without the .com (extension depends on the fqdn webserver01.mylabserver), and only then if there are no matches will Puppet go to default.

68) What information does PuppetDB contain?
Incorrect

Correct answer
The most recent facts from every node, The most recent catalog for every node

69) Given the following information, what classes would you expect to be declared on the node? : certname "webserver1.mylabserver.com" node /^webserver\d{1}.mylabserver.net$/ { include roles::webserver } node /^webserver\d{1}.mylabserver$/ { include roles::apache } node "webserver1.mylabserver" { include roles::apache } node "webserver1" { include roles::nginx } node default { include base }

Explanation
When referencing a resource managed by Puppet you must always use a capital to reference the title. Package['ntp'] instead of package['ntp']

73) Given the following Puppet code what value would you expect $server to have when executed in the notify resource?: node "webserver.mylabserver.com" { $server = "10.0.0.1" class { 'ntp' : } } class ntp ($server) { notify ("The value of the server variable is ${server}":) }

94) Which of the following are not built-in report processors with Puppet?
Correct

Correct answer
IRC

Explanation
Report processors are used in conjunction with the report setting in the puppet.conf file. Report processors take the YAML report that includes every log message that was generated during the transaction along with any metrics Puppet knows how to collect. The report processors determine how and where the reports should be routed when reporting is enabled. The reports setting used with the report processors is set on the Puppet masters puppet.conf file. reports = http, tagmail The report setting is different than the reports setting. The report setting determines if the agent is to send reporting information and is configured in the agent section of the agents puppet.conf file. More details of the reporting feature can be found in the Puppet documentation: https://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/configuration.html#reports

95) You have a Puppet node with the node name of "node1.mylabserver.com". This node has been destroyed and rebuilt and puppet agent has been run again for the first time.

Correct answer
Must begin with a lowercase letter, Can include numbers and underscores but not start with them

103) Which of the following are type of events found in the event inspector?
Incorrect

Correct answer
Skipped: a requirement for this resource was not met. Thus Puppet does not compare its current state to the desired state. This will occur when the schedule metaparemter is set and the time interval does not meet the requirements or it is a general failure of the resource type being enforced, No-op: property was out of sync but Puppet was instructed not to make changes to the property

Explanation
Skipped, change, no-op, and failure are the change event types found in the event inspector.

104) Given the following code and a node running the environment name "dev" and a hostname of webserver01.mylabserver.com what will the URL value be?: $confdir/hiera.yaml file -- :backends: - yaml :yaml: :datadir: /etc/puppet/hieradata :hierarchy: - “%{::environment}" - “%{::certname}" - common Given the following Hiera data #common.yaml url: www.mydomain.com #dev.yaml url: dev.mydomain.com #production.yaml url: mydomain.com #webserver01.yaml url: webserver.mydomain.com class show_url { $url = hiera('url') }

Correct

Correct answer
True

108) The Puppet master event inspector is reporting a "change" event on the httpd package resource type in your Puppet module. What most likely has occurred with the resource type?
Correct

Correct answer
The httpd configuration was incorrect and the Puppet configuration updated the correct configuration

Explanation
A change event occurs when a property is out-of-sync and Puppet made a change to enforce the desired configuration and put the property in the desired state

109) Which attribute that belongs to the exec resource type makes it idempotent?
